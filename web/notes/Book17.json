An offer to buy land for the canal had been rejected by the Colombian senate, who thought the U.S. monetary offer was too low.\nThe Panamanians feared the U.S. would choose the Nicaraguan route for the canal; Panama would miss out on a prosperity created by the canal's construction.

The revolt was led by Bunau-Varilla.\u00a0 \nBunau-Varilla became the Panamanian \nminister to the United States and signed the Hay-Bunau-Varilla Treaty in \nWashington.\u00a0 The treaty gave the U.S. control of a 10-mile zone around the \nproposed Panama Canal.\nThe involvement in Panama marked a downward lurch in U.S. \u00a0relations with Latin America.\u00a0 \nIn 1904 the construction of the Panama Canal began, and it was completed in 1914 at a cost of $400 million."

Vice President \nSpiro Agnew was also forced to resign for taking bribes.\u00a0Congress \nreplaced Agnew with Gerald Ford. \nA select Senate committee, headed by Senator Sam Erving, led an investigation \ninto the corruption. Nixon claimed no knowledge of the illegal activities, but \nJohn Dean III, a former White House lawyer, testified about how Nixon \ntried to cover up the Watergate Scandal.\nOn October 20, 1973 (\"Saturday Night Massacre\"), Nixon fired Archibald \nCox, the prosecutor of the Watergate Scandal case who had issued a subpoena \nof the tapes.\u00a0 The attorney general and deputy attorney general resigned \nbecause they did not want to fire Cox.\nWhen conversations involving the Watergate Scandal were discovered on tapes, \nPresident Nixon refused to hand them over to Congress, despite denying any participation \nin the scandal. On July 24, 1974, the Supreme Court ruled that President \nNixon had to submit all tapes to Congress.\u00a0 On August 5, 1974, Nixon \nreleased the three tapes that held the most damaging information. One of the \ntapes (\"smoking gun\" tape) proved that Nixon had \nplayed an active part of the attempted cover-up of the Watergate Scandal.\nOn August 8, 1974, Nixon resigned due to pressures from \nhis own party."
