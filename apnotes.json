The Seditious Committees of CorrespondenceLord North, the prime minister of Britain, was forced to persuade Parliament to repeal the Townshend revenue duties.Samuel Adams: master propagandist and engineer of rebellion; formed the first local committee of correspondence in Massachusetts in 1772 (Sons of Liberty).Committees of Correspondence were created by the American colonies in order to maintain communication with one another. They were organized in the decade before the Revolution when communication between the colonies became essential.In March of 1773, the Virginia House of Burgesses, the lower house of the Colony of Virginia, proposed that each colonial legislature appoint a standing committee for intercolonial correspondence. Within just a year, nearly all of the colonies had joined. Tea Brewing in BostonIn 1773, the British East India Company was overstocked with 17 million pounds of unsold tea.If the company collapsed, the London government would lose tax revenue.Therefore, the London government gave the company the exclusive right to sell tea in America (at a discount). Fearing that it was trick to get the colonists to pay import taxes, the colonists rejected the tea.When the ships arrived in the Boston harbor, the governor of Massachusetts, Thomas Hutchinson, forced the citizens to allow the ships to unload their tea.On December 16, 1773, a band of Bostonians, disguised as Indians, boarded the ships and dumped the tea into the sea.(Boston Tea Party) Parliament Passes the \"Intolerable Acts\"In 1774, Parliament punished the people of Massachusetts for their actions in the Boston Tea Party.Parliament passed laws, known as the Intolerable Acts, which restricted colonists' rights.The laws restricted town meetings and required that officials who killed colonists in the line of duty to be sent to Britain for trial (where it was assumed they would be acquitted of their charges). Another law was the Boston Port Act.It closed the Boston harbor until damages were paid and order could be ensured.The Quebec Act was also passed in 1774, but was not apart of the Intolerable Acts.It gave Catholic French Canadians religious freedom and restored the French form of civil law. The American colonists opposed this act for a variety of reasons: it angered anti-Catholics; it extended the land area of Quebec. BloodshedIn 1774, the First Continental Congress met in Philadelphia to respond to colonial grievances over the Intolerable Acts.12 of the 13 colonies (excluding Georgia) sent 55 men to the convention.(The First Continental Congress was not a legislative body; it was a consultative body. It was a convention rather than a congress.)After 7 weeks of deliberation, the 1st Continental Congress created several papers.The papers included a Declaration of Rights and appeals to other British-American colonies, to the king, and to the British people.The creation of The Association was the most important outcome of the Congress.It called for a complete boycott of British goods: nonimportation, nonexportation, and nonconsumption.In April 1775, the British commander in Boston sent a detachment of troops to Lexington and Concord. Their plan was to seize stocks of colonial gunpowder and to capture the \"rebel\" ringleaders, Samuel Adams and John Hancock.At Lexington, 8 Americans were shot and killed.This incident was labelled as the \"Lexington Massacre.\"When the British went to Concord, they were met with American resistance and had over 300 casualties and 70 deaths.Because of this, the British realized that they had a war, rather than a rebellion, on their hands.

Congress overruled the President's veto for this bill.\nFearing that the Southerners might someday repeal the Civil Rights Law, Congress passed the 14th Amendment in 1866.The amendment had the following components:1) Gave civil rights, including citizenship, to the freedmen; 2) Reduced proportionately the representation of a state in Congress and in the Electoral College if it denied blacks the right to vote; 3) Disqualified from federal and state offices former Confederates who, as federal officeholders, had once sworn to support the Constitution of the United States; 4) Guaranteed the federal debt, while the Union assumed all Confederate debts.\nWith the ability to overrule a presidential veto, Congress began to develop into the dominant role in controlling the government.\nAll Republicans agreed that no state should be welcomed back into the Union without ratifying the 14th Amendment."

The commission ultimately gave the election to Hayes (Republican).\nThe Democrats were outraged at the outcome of the election, but agreed that Hayes could take office if he withdrew the federal troops from Louisiana and South Carolina.\nWith the Hayes-Tilden deal, the Republican Party abandoned its commitment to racial equality.\nThe Civil Rights Act of 1875 was supposed to guarantee equal accommodations in public places and prohibited racial discrimination in jury selection.The Supreme Court ultimately ruled most of the Act unconstitutional, stating that the 14th Amendment only prohibited government violations of civil rights, not the denial of civil rights by individuals."

They either returned home or remained in America and faced extraordinary hardships.\nPeople on the West Coast attributed declining wages and economic troubles to the hated Chinese workers.To appease them, Congress passed the Chinese Exclusion Act in 1882, stopping Chinese immigration into America."

They called for a graduated income tax; government ownership of the railroads, telegraph, and telephone; the direct election of U.S. senators; a one-term limit on the presidency; the adoption of the initiative and referendum to allow citizens to shape legislation more directly; a shorter workday; and immigration restriction.\nThe Populists nominated General James B. Weaver for the presidential election of 1892.\nIn 1892, a series of violent worker strikes swept through the nation, including the Homestead Strike.\nThe Populist Party did not win the election.One of the main reasons was that the party supported the black community.The party's leaders, such as Thomas Edward Watson, felt that a black man had a right to vote.The party counted on many black votes from the South, but many Southern blacks were denied the right to vote through literacy tests and poll taxes.The Southern whites voted against the party because of the party's equal rights views toward blacks.\nCleveland and Depression\nGrover Cleveland again ran for president in theelection of 1892 and won, beating out the Populist Party and the Republican Party.\nThe panic of 1893 was the United States' worst economic depression in the 1800s.It was caused by overbuilding, over-speculation, and the agricultural depression.\nThe Sherman Silver Purchase Act of 1890 was created by Benjamin Harrison, and it forced the government to purchase a certain amount of silver every month. Indebted farmers pushed for the Act because they wanted to cause inflation so they could pay off their debts with cheaper money. People started to exchange their silver for gold from the government. An increase in silver production lead to a significant drain on the Treasury's gold reserves, which decreased confidence in the country's finances. Because of this, Cleveland was forced to repeal the Sherman Silver Act Purchase in 1893.\nJ.P. Morgan lent the government $65 million in gold to increase the Treasury's reserve."

        "text": "In 1917, the Bolshevik Revolution (communist) in Russia overthrew the tsar regime. The new regime decided to pull Russia out of the \"capitalist\" war. This freed up thousands of Germans on the Russian front to fight against France on the western front.\nA year after Congress declared war, the first American troops reached France.They were used as replacements in the Allied armies and were generally deployed in quiet sectors with the British and French.Shipping shortages plagued the Allies.\nAmerican troops were also sent to Belgium, Italy, and Russia. Americas were sent to Russia because they hoped to prevent Russian munitions from falling into the hands of the Germans.\nIn the spring of 1918, the Allies, for the first time, united under a supreme commander, French marshal Foch to fight the German expansion on the western front.\nTo stop Germany from taking Paris and France, 30,000 American troops were sent to the French frontlines.This was the first significant engagement of American troops in a European war.\nBy July 1918, the German expansion was halted and Foch made a counteroffensive in the Second Battle of the Marne.This engagement marked the beginning of a German withdrawal.\nThe Americans, dissatisfied with simply bolstering the French and British, demanded a separate army; General John J. Pershing was assigned a front of 85 miles.Pershing's army undertook the Meuse-Argonne offensive from September 26 to November 11, 1918.One objective was to cut the German railroad lines feeding the western front.Inadequate training left 10% of the Americans involved in the battle injured or killed.\nAs German supplies ran low and as their allies began to desert them, defeat was in sight for Germany.\nGermany surrendered on November 11, 1918, after the kaiser of Germany had fled to Holland.\nThe United States' main contributions to the victory had been foodstuffs, munitions, credits, oil, and manpower.The Americans only fought 2 major battles, at St. Mihiel and the Meuse-Argonne.The prospect of endless U.S. troops, rather than America's actual military performance eventually demoralized the Germans."

He thought it would help him negotiate and pass a treaty. This angered much of the public, and voters instead elected a Republican majority to Congress.\nWilson's decision to go to Paris in person to negotiate the treaty infuriated the Republicans because no president had ever traveled to Europe."

In February 1919, the the Big Four agreed to include the creation of the League in the treaty.\nFrance gave up claims for the Saar Valley (part of Germany); it would remain separate from France for 15 years, and then a popular vote would determine its fate. In exchange for this, Britain and America agreed to the Security Treaty: American and Britain would defend France if Germany invaded again.\nItaly demanded Fiume, a valuable seaport inhabited by both Italians and Yugoslavs. Wilson wanted it to go to the Yugoslavs, but this was opposed by the Italians. Ownership of the area was ultimately not established.\nJapan demanded China's Shandong Peninsula and the German islands of the Pacific, which it had seized during the war.After Japan threatened to walk out, Wilson accepted a compromise in which Japan kept Germany's economic holdings in Shandong and pledged to return the peninsula to China at a later date.\nThe Treaty of Versailles was forced upon the Germans in June 1919.The Germans were outraged with the treaty, which spoke more of vengeance than reconciliation. Most of the Fourteen Points were left out of the treaty.\nWilson compromised away some of his Fourteen Points in attempts to salvage the League of Nations."

The speeches had mixed reactions. During the tour, Wilson suffered a stroke.\nSenator Lodge, a critic to the president, came up with fourteen reservations to the Treaty of Versailles. He wanted to give the U.S. more control over how it interacted with other nations and how these nations interacted with it.\nWilson strongly opposed the reservations, and after the Senate rejected the Treaty twice, the Treaty of Versailles was defeated."

The public opposed this, so FDR did not follow through with his plan.\nIn 1937, Japanese planes sunk an American ship, the Panay. Tokyo quickly apologized and the United States accepted.\nIn 1935, Hitler violated the Treaty of Versailles when he introduced mandatory military service in Germany.In 1936, he again violated the treaty when he took over the demilitarized German Rhineland.\nIn March 1938, Hitler invaded Austria.(Note: Austria actually voted for the occupation, fully aware that if it resisted, Germany would forcefully take over Austria.)\nAt a conference in Munich, Germany in September 1938, the Western European democracies allowed Germany to keep Sudetenland (part of Czechoslovakia). They hoped that this would stop Hitler from taking over other countries. It did not.\nIn March 1939, Hitler took over all ofCzechoslovakia.(See Austria note.)"

(The previous Neutrality Acts prohibited trade with them.) This new act let the European democracies buy American war materials as long as they transported the goods on their own ships and paid in cash. This allowed America to avoid loans, war debts, and the sinking of American ships.\nThe demand for war goods helped end the recession of 1937-1938, and it solved the decade-long unemployment crisis.\nThe Fall of France\nThe months after the fall of Poland were known as the \"phonywar\" because France and the U.K. were not really militiarily involved in the war, yet.\nThe Soviet Union took over Finland despite Congress loaning $30 million to Finland.\nThe phoney war ended in April-May 1940 when Hitler took over Denmark, Norway, the Netherlands, and Belgium. France fell in June 1940.\nWhen France surrendered, Americans realized that England was all that stood in the way of Hitler controlling all of Europe. FDR and Congress quickly set out to build large airfleets and a two-ocean navy. On September 6, 1940, Congress passed a conscription law; under this measure, America's first peacetime draft was initiated.\nAt the Havana Conference of 1940, the United States agreed to protect Latin America from German aggression (extension of the Monroe Doctrine)."

During the Battle of Britain, radio broadcasts brought the drama from London air raids directly into America homes. Sympathy for Britain grew, but it was not yet sufficient to push the United States into war.\nThe most powerful group of those who supported aid for Britain was the Committee to Defend America by Aiding the Allies.Isolationists organized the America First Committee, contending that America should concentrate what strength it had to defend its own shores.\nOn September 2, 1940, President Roosevelt transferred 50 destroyers left over from WWI to Britain.In return, Britain gave to the United States 8 valuable defensive base sites in the Western Hemisphere. This transfer of warships was a flagrant violation of America's neutrality obligations."

It allowed America to lease arms to the democracies of the world that needed them. (Europeans didn't have the cash to buy the arms; cash was required by the Neutrality Act of 1939.) When the war was over, the guns and tanks could be returned.Opponents of the bill, like Senator Taft, criticized it, saying that the arms would be destroyed and unable to be returned after the war. It was pitched as a program that would allow the democracies to win the war and keep it away from America.\nThe bill marked the abandonment of any pretense of neutrality.\nHitler saw the Lend-Lease Bill as an unofficial declaration of war. Until then, Germany had avoided attacking U.S. ships, but on May 21, 1941, the Robin Moor, an unarmed American merchantman, was destroyed by a German submarine in the South Atlantic, outside the war zone."

He hoped to take the oil and other resources of the Soviet Union and then concentrate on Britain. President Roosevelt sent military supplies to the USSR.\nIn August 1941, Roosevelt and British Prime Minister Winston Churchill met and came up with the eight-point Atlantic Charter at the Atlantic Conference.

The Big Three also announced plans for fashioning a new international peacekeeping organization (the United Nations).\nThe most controversial decision regarded the Far East. American casualties were expected to be high in the war against Japan, so Stalin agreed to attack Japan after the collapse of Germany. In return, the Soviets were given the southern half of Sakhalin Island, lost by Russia to Japan in 1905, and Japan's Kurile Islands.The Soviet Union was also given control over the railroads of China's Manchuria and special privileges in the two key seaports of that area, Dairen and Port Arthur.These concessions gave Stalin control over vital industrial centers of China.\nThe agreements at the Yalta Conference were not really binding.

These spheres of influence contradicted President FDR's Wilsonian dream of an \"open world,\" decolonized, demilitarized, and democratized.\nEach country believed in the universal expanse of its own form of government.

Representatives from 50 nations made the United Nations charter.It included the Security Council, dominated by the Big Fivepowers (the United States, Britain, the USSR, France, and China), each of whom had the right of veto, and the General Assembly, which could be controlled by smaller countries.The Senate overwhelmingly passed the document on July 28, 1945.\nThe U.N. has helped people throughout the world via organizations like UNESCO (United Nations Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organization), FAO (Food and Agricultural Organization), and WHO (World Health Organization).\nIn 1946, Bernard Baruch wanted to create a U.N.agency, free from the great-power veto, with worldwide authority over atomic energy, weapons, and research.The plan fell apart as neither the United States nor the Soviet Union wanted to give up their nuclear weapons."

The Soviets refused to support the development of Germany because they feared another German-initiated war.\nAt the end of the war, Austria and Germany were divided into 4 military occupation zones, each assigned to one of the Big Four powers (France, Britain,America, and the USSR).\nDenied post-war economic support from America, the USSR wanted to take war reparations from Germany.\nAs the USSR spread communism to its Eastern zone in Germany and the Western Allies promoted the idea of a reunited Germany, Germany was divided into 2 zones.West Germany became an independent country, andEast Germany became bound to the Soviet Union as an independent \"satellite\" state, shutoff from the Western world by the \"iron curtain\" of the Soviet Union.\nBerlin, still occupied by the Four Big powers, was completely surrounded by the Soviet Occupation Zone.In 1948, the Soviet Union attempted to starve the Allies out of Berlin by cutting off all rail and highway access to the city.In May 1949, after America had flown in many supplies, the blockade was lifted.\nIn 1949, the governments of East and West Germany were established."

Kennan came up with the \"containment doctrine,\" which tried to explain the behavior of the USSR. This concept stated that the USSR was relentlessly expansionary and that the USSR could be contained by being firm and vigilant.\nThis doctrine was embraced by President Truman in 1947 when Congress passed the Truman Doctrine. This gave financial support to Greece to resist communist pressures. Truman declared that it must be the policy of the United States to aid any country that was resisting communist aggression.\nFollowing WWII, France, Italy, and Germany were suffering from the hunger and economic chaos caused by the war. They were in danger of being taken over by Communist parties within the countries. By promising financial aid, American Secretary of State George C. Marshall convinced the Europeans to create a joint plan for their economic recovery. Marshall offered the same aid to the Soviet Union and its allies, but the Soviets refused it. The Marshall Plan gave $12.5 billion to 16 European countries. Within a few years, Europe's economy was flourishing, and the Communist parties had lost ground.\nAccess to Middle Eastern oil was crucial to the European recovery program and to the health of the U.S. economy.Despite threats from the Arab nations to cut off the supply of oil, President Truman officially recognized the state of Israel on May 14, 1948."

The heads of each branch of the military were brought together as the Joint Chiefs of Staff.\nThe National Security Act also established the National Security Council (NSC) to advise the president on security matters, and it created the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) to coordinate the government's foreign fact-gathering.\nIn 1948, the United States joined the European pact, called the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO).The pact pledged each nation to regard an attack on one as an attack on all. The pact also marked a departure from American diplomatic convention, a boost for European unification, and a significant step in the militarization of the Cold War.\nReconstruction and Revolution in Asia\nGeneral Douglas MacArthur took control of the democratization of Japan.The Japanese people cooperated with his plans; they saw that good behavior and the adoption of democracy would speed the end of the occupation.In 1946, a MacArthur-dictated constitution was adopted.It renounced militarism and introduced western-style democratic government.\nFrom 1946-1948, top Japanese \"war criminals\" were tried in Tokyo.\nIn late 1949, the Chinese Nationalist government ofGeneralissimo Jiang Jieshi was forced to flee the country to the island of Formosa (Taiwan) when the communists, led by Mao Zedong, took over the country.The collapse of Nationalist China was a depressing loss for America and its allies in the Cold War, as \u00bc of the world's population fell to communism.\nIn September 1949, the Soviet Union exploded its first atomic bomb, 3 years before experts thought possible.To stay one step ahead, Truman ordered the development of theH-bomb (Hydrogen Bomb).The first H-bomb was exploded in 1952.The Soviets exploded their first H-bomb in 1953, and the nuclear arms race entered a dangerously competitive cycle."

NSC-68 was a key document of the Cold War because it marked a major step in the militarization of American foreign policy.\nOn June 25, 1950, the North Korean army invaded South Korea. In response to this, Truman ordered a massive military buildup, well beyond what was necessary for the Korean War. Without Congress's approval, Truman ordered American air and naval units to be sent to support South Korea. The U.N. was responsible for sending troops to fight the North Koreans, but the fight was led by General MacArthur and most of the troops were American."

United States (1951).\nIn 1938, the House of Representatives established the Committee on Un-American Activities (HUAC) to investigate \"subversion\" (opposition to the government).In 1948, Congressman Richard M. Nixon led the conviction of Alger Hiss, a prominent ex-New Dealer. Americans began to join in on the hunt for communist spies who were thought to be living in America.\nIn 1950, Truman vetoed the McCarran Internal Security Bill, which authorized the president to arrest and detain suspicious people during an \"internal security emergency.\"Congress overrode Truman's veto and passed the bill.\nIn 1951, Julius and Ethel Rosenberg were convicted and sentenced to death for stealing American atomic bomb plans and selling them to the Soviet Union.They were the only people in history to be sentenced to death for espionage.\nIn February 1950, Republican Senator Joseph R. McCarthy accused Secretary of State Dean Acheson of employing 205 Communist party members.Even though the accusations later proved to be false, McCarthy gained the support of the public. With the Republican victory in the election of 1952, his rhetoric became bolder as his accusations of communism grew.\nMcCarthyism, the practice of spreading treasonous accusations without evidence, thrived during the Cold War. Though McCarthy was not the first red-hunter, he was the most ruthless.\nIn 1954, McCarthy went too far and attacked the U.S. Army.Just a few months later, he was condemned by the Senate for \"conduct unbecoming a member.\" (Army-McCarthy hearings)\nExecutive Order 9981 desegregated the armed forces."

It failed in 1948 because it couldn't overcome fears of racial mixing.\nThe Employment Act of 1946 created a 3-member Council of Economic Advisers to advise the president on policies regarding employment, production, and purchasing power.\nThe Servicemen's Readjustment Act of 1944 (GI Bill of Rights / GI Bill), made money available to send former WWII soldiers to school. This bill raised educational levels and stimulated the construction industry; this helped to create the economic expansion that started in the late 1940s."

The new Progressive party nominated Henry A. Wallace.Truman won and was reelectedas president.Truman's victory came from the votes of farmers, workers, and blacks.\nPresident Truman supported a plan to lend American money to underdeveloped countries (\"bold new program\" or \"Point Four\" program). He wanted to help these countries develop before they succumbed to communism.\nAt home, Truman supported a \"Fair Deal\" program in1949. It called for improved housing, full employment, a higher minimum wage, better farm price supports, new TVAs, and an extension of Social Security.Congress only passed parts of the program: raises to the minimum wage; creation of public housing in the Housing Act of 1949; extension of old-age insurance to many more beneficiaries in the Social Security Act of 1950."

Increased productivity was caused by improved technology and the rising educational level of the workforce.\nMechanization and fertilizers increased the productivity of farms.

The population in this region grew nearly twice as fast as in the Northeast (the \"Frostbelt\").In the 1950s, California alone accounted for 1/5 of the nation's population growth. It became the most populous state in 1963.\nPeople moved to the sunbelt in search of jobs, better climate, and lower taxes. The sunbelt states' economic prosperity was large due to the fact that this region received significantly more federal money that the North. The industrial region of the Ohio Valley (the \"Rustbelt\") was especially hit hard as a result of the loss in federal funds and population."

Migrating blacks from the South moved into the abandoned inner cities. The FHA often refused blacks home mortgages for private home purchases, thus limiting black mobility out of the inner cities."

This was an attempt by America to overthrow the Castro regime. President Kennedy was against the direct intervention of the overthrow of Castro, so he did not provide sufficient support for the exiles. Hence, the invasion failed after the exiles were forced to surrender.\nContinued American attempt to overthrow Castro caused Castro to further support the Soviets. In October 1962, it was discovered that the Soviets were secretly installing nuclear missiles inCuba.Kennedy ordered a naval \"quarantine\" of Cuba and demanded immediate removal of the weapons.For a week, Americans waited while Soviet ships approached the patrol line established by the U.S. Navy off the island of Cuba.

Following the war, Israel gained the territories of the Golan Heights, the Gaza Strip, and the West Bank.\nAntiwar demonstrations increased significantly as more and more American soldiers died in the Vietnam War. Senator William Fulbright held a series of televised hearings in 1966 and 1967 in which he convinced the public that it had been deceived about the causes and \"winnability\" of the war.\nWhen Defense Secretary McNamara expressed discomfort about the war, he was quietly removed from office.\nBy early 1968, the Vietnam War had become the longest and most unpopular foreign war in the nation's history. The government failed to justify the war. Casualties exceeded 100,000, and more bombs had been dropped in Vietnam than in World War II.\nIn 1967, Johnson ordered the CIA to spy on domestic antiwar activists.He also encouraged the FBI to use its counterintelligence program, code-named \"Cointelpro,\" to investigate members of the peace movement."

Wallace, called for the of segregation of blacks.\nThe Republican and Democrat candidates supported the Vietnam War in the election of 1968.\nDespite winning most major cities and about 95% of the black vote, the Democrats lost the election; Richard Nixon won the election of 1968.\nNo president since Lincoln had done more for civil rights than LBJ.The Vietnam War sucked tax dollars away from LBJ's Great Society programs, though.\nLBJ was persuaded by his advisors that an easy victory in Vietnam could be achieved by massive aerial bombing and large troop commitments.

The United States agreed to sell the Soviets at least $750 million worth of wheat, corn, and other cereals. Two agreements also slowed the arms race between America and the Soviets: 1) An anti-ballistic missile(AMB) treaty limited the U.S. and the Soviet Union to two clusters of defensive missiles. 2) SALT (Strategic Arms Limitation Talks) froze the numbers of long-range nuclear missiles for 5 years."

Reagan believed that this would stimulate new investment, boost productivity, promote dramatic economic growth, and reduce the federal deficit. (Reaganomics)\nIn 1981-1982, the economy slipped into a recession as unemployment rose and banks closed. The anti-inflationary polices that caused therecession of 1982 had actually been created by the Federal Reserve Board in 1979, during Carter's presidency.\nDuring the 1980s,income gaps widened between the rich and the poor.\nBy the mid-1980s, the economy had recovered. Economists speculated that the economy had recovered because of Reagan's massive military expenditures.Reagan gave the Pentagon nearly $2 trillion in the 1980s.

However, Reagan's large budget deficits helped make future social welfare programs seem economically infeasible. Thus, Reagan had achieved his goal of limiting the expansion of welfare programs.\nIn the early 1990s, median household income declined."

Antonia and Martin v. Wilks), the Court made it more difficult to prove that an employer practiced racial discrimination in hiring.\nAbortion - In Roe v. Wade (1973), the Court had prohibited states from making laws that interfered with a woman's right to an abortion during the early months of pregnancy.In Webster v. Reproductive Health Services (1989), the Supreme Court approved a Missouri law that imposed certain restrictions on abortion, signalling that a state could legislate in an area in which Roe had previously forbidden them to legislate.In Planned Parenthood v.
